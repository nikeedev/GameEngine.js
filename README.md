## **Playlib**: A 2D game framework made using HTML Canvas!

> [!NOTE]  
> I am back with developing further on the framework, a year of repositoty being archived! Big changes will happen, and the docs will be probably moved to a separate "mdbook" page on my GitHub Pages rather than on the Gitbook.io.

## Changelog:

Will be later adding updated in changelog.md file

Changelog for previous biggest update 0.5.0 lies in separate .md file, where you can see all changes that happened, here is it: [Changelog_for_v0.5.0.md](Changelog_for_v0.5.0.md)

0.6.0 lies directly in Changelog.md as it won't make a mess anymore.
<br>

If you want to see changelog for versions released before 0.5.0, it should lie in the changelog.md file, which is this: [changelog.md](changelog.md)
