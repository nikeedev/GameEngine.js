# Changes in PlayLib v0.5.0

First of all, thanks for choosing this library.

npm deprecate gameengine_js@0.4.0 "WARNING: This package has been renamed to playlib. Install using playlib instead."

For people who have used the "engine"(now will be called library) before, GameEngine.js will now be officially called: <span style="font-size: 20px; background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #61BB46, #FDB827, #E03A3E, #963D97, #009DDC);-webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent">PlayLib</span>!
