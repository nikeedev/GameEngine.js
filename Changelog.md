### **Changelog for GameEngine.js**
----
**v0.1.0** (Actually many of the stuff has been added separately, but i haven't any changelog before now, so here is all of stuff added before changelog): Size datatype for height and width; Vector2 datatype for x and y axis; Text class for making text, change its color, position and font; Rect class for making rectangles in any size and shape, has same abilities as Text class, unless the font variable; Info class for gathering current GameEngine.js version and print GameEngine.js logotype.

**v0.1.7**: Moved to `TypeScript`, and fixed stuff so the code works even with TypeScript.

**v0.2.0**: Added new Sprite class to the modules, to draw your fav sprites, instead of simple rects and texts.

**0.2.2**: Fixed the new Sprite class. The Sprite class unless other classes, must be initialized, because else the sprite will be drawn before it could even load it, resulting, that it will draw nothing. 

**0.2.3**: Added update function back to Sprite class.
