Since v0.5.3:
  - Updated scene class
  - Updated some stuff in Game class 
  - Added finally functionality for scene class
  - You can now "extend" (really implement, but that's not TypeScript...)
   the scene class to your own to create scenes that can later be used to change order on which to render first.
